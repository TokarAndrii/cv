  "profileDescription": "I have been working in the field of front-end development more than 3 years. During this period I’ve gained experience in building: web and native (ios, android) applications; backend servers for commercial projects. I achieved great results in front-end and full-stack developing using: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Node, TypeScript, React, React Native, GraphQL, Redux, Jest, Enzyme, Docker and other. Also in my work I used OOP concepts, SOLID, DRY, KISS. I want to work as JS developer (React, React Native, TypeScript, Node) at a progressive company on interesting projects where I can grow as programmer and bring maximum benefits to the company.",
